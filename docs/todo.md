## Immediate
- [x] Identify routes that serve a stop
- [x] Find next departure from stop along routes
- Calculate maximum trip along one line, returning to the origin at a specific time
	- start with first departure
## Medium
- Generate visual representation of a suggested trip
	- path of a route defined in `shapes.txt` and related to `trips.txt` by `shape_id`
## Long term
- Identify stations with indoor facilities from OSM data
	- add operating hours to stops table
## Misc
- remove unneeded packages
- convert tuple queries to dict queries
- mix of object and string datetimes, need to standardize on objects
