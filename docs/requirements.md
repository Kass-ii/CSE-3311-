- in class exercise
# Requirements
- App will generate route in under 10 seconds
- App must generate a visual representation of trip
- Algorithm must minimize time spent outdoors
	- Request directions from other directions app and calculate the time spent outdoors to compare to our output.
	- Compare output to rider behavior to identify any missed opportunities for optimization.
- Constrain algorithm to generate trips under certain classes of fare 
	- 3 hour pass, 
	- do not cross regional fare boundary etc
- Allow user to specify comfortable transfer times
- UI must be intuitive to users
	- Measure time it takes for users to generate directions
	- Create survey about layout of the app
		- Users will be friends who use public transit
